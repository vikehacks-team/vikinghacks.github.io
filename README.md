## Cloning to your computer
Now that you have your own fork that you can work on without
disrupting the main site, clone it to your computer so you can work
on it.

- Go to your fork of the VikingHacks website. The name of the repository,
    located at the top left of your screen should read <YOUR USERNAME>/vikinghacks.github.io
    and not VikingHacks/vikinghacks.github.io
